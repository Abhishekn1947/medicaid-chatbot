## Security Considerations

### Data Handling

- The chatbot does not store personal health information (PHI)
- All conversations are processed client-side
- No sensitive user data is transmitted to external servers
- Session data is cleared when the browser is closed

### Privacy Protection

- No user identification is required to use the chatbot
- IP addresses are not logged or tracked
- Analytics data is anonymized and aggregated
- Compliance with HIPAA privacy requirements

### Access Control

- No administrative backend requiring authentication
- Static deployment reduces attack surface
- All dependencies are regularly updated for security patches

### Browser Security

- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers implemented
- XSS protection through Angular's built-in sanitization
- No use of `eval()` or dynamic code execution
- Secure communication over HTTPS only

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Use the latest version of your web browser
- Ensure your connection is secure (HTTPS)
- Clear browser cache after sensitive sessions
- Report suspicious behavior immediately

### For Developers
- Keep all dependencies up to date
